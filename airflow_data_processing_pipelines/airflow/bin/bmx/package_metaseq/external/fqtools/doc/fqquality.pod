=head1 NAME

=over 4

=item B<fqquality> - FastQ sequence quality filter

=back

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 4

=item B<fqquality> [options] -i F<file> [F<file>]

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

Following command line options are allowed:

=over 4

=item -b F<value>

Overall bad quality maximum percent. Default to 100.0%.

=item -d

Decrease low quality values to minimum.

=item -h

Usage display.

=item -l F<value>

Minimum sequence length F<value>. Default to 0.

=item -m

Mask low quality bases.

=item -p F<string>

Prepend output file names with given F<string> prefix.

=item -q F<value>

Use F<value> for quality cutoff. Default to 0.

=item -t

Trim low quality bases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<fqquality> is a small tool that allows filtering fastq sequences on
quality criteria. For now only illumina quality model is supported.

The following methods can be applied, in sequence :

=over 4

=item - F<Discard sequences with bad overall quality percent> (B<-b>)

Sequence where the percentage of bases below the quality cutoff is
lower than the provided value will be discarded.

=item - F<Mask low quality bases> (B<-m>)

Bases where quality value is lower than provided cutoff, will be
masked using the `N' character.

=item - F<Decrease low quality values to minimum> (B<-d>)

Bases where quality value is lower than provided cutoff, will have
their value lowered to the minimum supported one (letter B).

=item - F<Trim bases with low quality value on both ends> (B<-t>)

Bases where quality value is lower than provided cutoff, will be
trimmed from both sequence ends.

=item - F<Discard sequences smaller than a specified length> (B<-l>)

Sequences where length is smaller than the provided value will be
discarded.

=back

The results will be stored in the following files :

- F<xxxxx_1.fq> will hold sequences from input file 1 (single-read and
paired-ends)

- F<xxxxx_2.fq> will hold sequences from input file 2 (paired-ends).

- F<xxxxx_s.fq> will hold singlet sequences from both input files 1
and 2 (paired-ends).
