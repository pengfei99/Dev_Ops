# /etc/nsswitch.conf
#
# An example Name Service Switch config file. This file should be
# sorted with the most-used services at the beginning.
#
# The entry '[NOTFOUND=return]' means that the search for an
# entry should stop if the search in the previous entry turned
# up nothing. Note that if the search failed due to some other reason
# (like no NIS server responding) then the search continues with the
# next entry.
#
# Valid entries include:
#
#       nis                     Use NIS+ (NIS version 3)
#       nis                     Use NIS (NIS version 2), also called YP
#       dns                     Use DNS (Domain Name Service)
#       files                   Use the local files
#       db                      Use the local database (.db) files
#       compat                  Use NIS on compat mode
#       hesiod                  Use Hesiod for user lookups
#       [NOTFOUND=return]       Stop searching if not found so far
#

# To use db, put the "db" in front of "files" for entries you want to be
# looked up first in the databases
#
# Example:
#passwd:    db files nis nis
#shadow:    db files nis nis
#group:     db files nis nis

passwd:     files sss ldap
shadow:     files sss ldap
group:      files sss ldap

#hosts:     db files nis nis dns
hosts:      files dns myhostname

# Example - obey only what nis tells us...
#services:   nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
#networks:   nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
#protocols:  nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
#rpc:        nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
#ethers:     nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
#netmasks:   nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
